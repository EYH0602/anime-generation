\subsection*{Conclusion}

Although the booming of AI drawing after the release of LDMs has also increased
the possibility of anime drawing by AI,
there are still concerns about AI anime drawing.
The first issue is that machine learning models often pay more attention to common features
in the training dataset,
instead of trying to understand the reason that led to these features.
For example, the shojo style is a way to represent emotion and psychological movements,
but is not the goal of anime drawing.
Secondly, I conclude that there is still a remaining ethical issue in AI anime drawing.
These two issues should be considered when integrating AI models into production.
Furthermore, style learning based on GAN requires high-quality data that have similar styles and large amounts,
whereas text-to-image generating models cannot keep the consistency of style of a character,
thus is hard to use in real anime production.
Therefore, I believe that style-controlled LDMs might have great potential in the anime industry if 
both issues, especially ethical issues, can be resolved.
